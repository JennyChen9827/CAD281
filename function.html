# Functions in C – Step by Step Guide
```
Functions help organize code into reusable blocks, improve readability, and enable easier debugging and testing.
```
---

## 🔍 What Is a Function?
```
A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task.
```
---

## 🧱 Structure of a Function

```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // body of the function
    return value;
}
```

---

## ✅ Example: Basic Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int result = add(3, 4); // Function call
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

---

## 🔁 Why Use Functions?

- Reuse code multiple times
- Keep `main()` clean and readable
- Break large problems into small parts

---

## ⏱ When and Where to Use

| When | Where |
|------|-------|
| Repeating code | In separate files or below `main()` |
| To improve modularity | Inside libraries or headers |
| To isolate logic | Each task as one function |

---

## 🛠 Common Types of Functions

1. No arguments, no return:
```c
void sayHello() {
    printf("Hello!\n");
}
```

2. With arguments, no return:
```c
void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hi %s!\n", name);
}
```

3. With arguments and return:
```c
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Errors

| Mistake | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Missing return value | Undefined behavior if return type is non-void |
| Wrong return type | Causes compiler warnings or crashes |
| Forgetting to declare function | Implicit declarations are not allowed in modern C |
| Using global variables without care | Can lead to bugs and hard-to-track issues |

---

## 📌 Function Declaration vs Definition

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Declaration | Tells the compiler function exists (`int add(int, int);`) |
| Definition | Actual code of the function |

---

## 📚 Best Practices

- Use meaningful function names
- Keep functions short and focused on one task
- Declare before use or use header files
- Avoid global variables when possible

---

## ✅ Summary

- Functions divide your code into logical blocks.
- You should define and declare them properly.
- Understand when to return values and how to pass parameters.
